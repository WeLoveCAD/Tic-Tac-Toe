# Project Introduction
Tic Tac Toe is a very popular paper-and-pencil game in a 3x3 grid for two players. The player who makes the first three of their marks in a diagonal, vertical, or horizontal row wins the game.

Rules for Tic Tac Toe:
1. The game is played on a grid 3x3 which is represented by leds.
2. There will be two players who are player1 and player2. Players take turns to light up the nine LEDs given. Player1 represented by LEDs with red colour while player2 represented by LEDs with green colour.
3. The player who successfully lights up three leds in a row which is up, down, across, or diagonally is the winner. The winnerâ€™s LED will light up when one of the players wins  the game.
