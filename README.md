2. There will be two players who are player1 and player2. Players take turns to light up the nine LEDs given. Player1 represented by LEDs with red colour while player2 represented    by LEDs with green colour.
3. The player who successfully lights up three leds in a row which is up, down, across, or diagonally is the winner. (The winning patterns are as shown in Figure below.) The winnerâ€™s LED will light up when one of the players wins      the game.
